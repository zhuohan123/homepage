# About Me

I am a PhD student in Computer Science at UC Berkeley advised by [Ion Stoica](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~istoica/).  Before that, I received my B.S. in Computer Science from Peking University, advised by [Liwei Wang](http://www.liweiwang-pku.com/).

My interest lies in the intersection of machine learning and distributed systems. I use insights from different domains to improve the performance (accuracy, efficiency, and interpretability) of current machine learning models.

I am currently working on [Alpa](https://github.com/alpa-projects/alpa), an automatic model parallel training framework.
